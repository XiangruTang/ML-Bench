## Docker Setup

Please refer to [envs](envs/README.md) for details.

## OpenAI Calling

Please refer to [openai](script/openai/README.md) for details.

## Open Source Model Fine-tuning

Please refer to [finetune](script/finetune/README.md) for details.

## Tools

### Get BM25 result

Run `python utils/bm25.py` to generate BM25 results for the instructions and readme. Ensure to update the original dataset `path` and output `path` which includes the BM25 results.

### Crawl README files from github repository

Run `python utils/crawl.py` to fetch readme files from a specific GitHub repository. You'll need to modify the `url` within the code to retrieve the desired readme files.
