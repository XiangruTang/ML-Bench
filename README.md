## OpenAI Calling

You can use the following script to reproduce OpenAI's performance on this taskï¼š
```python
bash script/openai/run.sh
```

You need to change parameter settings in `script/openai/run.sh` :

* `type`: Choose from quarter or full.

* `model`: Model name 

* `input_file`: File path of dataset

* `answer_file`: Original answer json format from GPT.

* `parsing_file`: Post-process the output of GPT in jsonl format to obtain executable code segments.

* `readme_type`: Choose from oracle_segment and readme

  *# `oracle_segment`: The code paragraph in the readme that is most relevant to the task*

  *# `readme`: The entire text of the readme in the repository where the task is located*

* `engine_name`: Choose from gpt-35-turbo-16k and gpt-4-32.

* `n_turn`: GPT returns the number of executable codes (5 times in the paper experiment).

* `openai_key`: Your key.

## Open Source Model Fine-tuning
Please refer to [finetune](script/finetune/README.md) for details.

## Tools

### Get BM25 result

Run `python utils/bm25.py` to generate BM25 results for the instructions and readme. Ensure to update the original dataset `path` and output `path` which includes the BM25 results.

### Crawl README files from github repository

Run `python utils/crawl.py` to fetch readme files from a specific GitHub repository. You'll need to modify the `url` within the code to retrieve the desired readme files.
